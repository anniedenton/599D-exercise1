# “Like Lesbians Walking the Perimeter”: Experiences of U.S. LGBTQ+ Folks With Online Security, Safety, and Privacy Advice

Given stigma and threats surrounding being gay or transgender, LGBTQ+ folks often seek support and information on navigating identity and personal (digital and
physical) safety. While prior research on digital security advice focused on a general population and general
advice, our work focuses on queer security, safety, and
privacy advice-seeking to determine population-specific
needs and takeaways for broader advice research. We
conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews with 14
queer participants diverse across race, age, gender, sexuality, and socioeconomic status. We find that participants turn to their trusted queer support groups for advice, since they often experienced similar threats. We
also document reasons that participants sometimes reject
advice, including that it would interfere with their material livelihood and their potential to connect with others.
Given our results, we recommend that queer-specific and
general security and safety advice focus on specificity—
why and how—over consistency, because advice cannot
be one-size-fits-all. We also discuss the value of intersectionality as a framework for understanding vulnerability to harms in security research, since our participants’ overlapping identities affected their threat models
and advice perception.

# Introduction
About 80% of American LGBTQ+ (an umbrella
acronym including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,
and queer) adults use social media sites [98], including
for dating and connecting with loved ones. Due to the
stigma attached to LGBTQ+ or queer (hereafter used interchangeably) identity, particularly for transgender and
non-binary individuals, social media and the web at large
can be a safety net to combat alienation [64, 92, 49], but
also be a place of significant potential harm [92, 46, 100].
In this paper, and in line with prior work [86, 41], we are
interested in potential harms broadly, rather than distinguishing between security, safety, and/or privacy.
Facing such risks online, an individual might seek
out advice from a variety of sources. Where does this
advice come from, and is it effective? While these
questions have been previously studied for general security and privacy advice for general populations [85,
87, 89, 88, 43, 90], LGBTQ+ individuals face identitybased risks that straight and cisgender individuals do
not [69, 38, 73]. Given prior work suggesting that prioritization increases advice adoption and efficacy, we
look to prioritizing and tailoring advice to specific threat
models. In this work, we evaluate participants’ experiences with advice targeted at queer-specific threat models rather than general online risks.
Our research questions are:
1. Where do queer individuals in the U.S. learn about
mechanisms for supporting their online security,
safety, and/or privacy?
2. What barriers prevent advice from being effective
for queer individuals?
3. How do multiple facets of identity impact queer individuals searching, acting on, or rejecting online
security, safety, and/or privacy advice?
To answer our research questions, we conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews with a diverse group of
14 queer individuals. We intentionally recruited for differences across age, race, gender, sexuality, and socioeconomic status so that we could take an intersectional
approach to data analysis, as “people’s lives... are better
understood as being shaped not by a single axis of social
division, be it race or gender or class, but by many axes
that work together and influence each other” [22].
Our major findings include:
1. Participants often turn to queer support groups for
advice and emotional support, in addition to other

sources like family or work. These support groups
serve both to provide individual advice as well as
to collectively combat community-level threats. In
one example, Participant 14 described her lesbian
social media group blocking trolls together “like
lesbians walking the perimeter” of their online community.
2. In addition to thinking of time spent or convenience
as a trade-off for adopting security advice, participants also lamented loss of business or joy of connecting with others as reasons to not adopt privacy
practices on social media.
3. Interlocking facets of identity affect people’s
perception and adoption of advice, and participants sometimes prioritize non-queer identity related threats.
Based on our results, we develop takeaways for better security, safety, and privacy advice, with conclusions likely applicable to other vulnerable or marginalized populations as well. For example, we observe that
specificity is more important than consistency for advice, since even people with a common identity (e.g.,
queer) may differ in their threat models (e.g., social media business-user who needs a public profile) and circumstances. As such, we also touch on how intersectionality
can be useful, even necessary, in security research when
threat modeling. Finally, we stress that advice is limited
in preventing harms by placing responsibility of safety
on an individual rather than on an institution.
2 Related Work
Our work is motivated by how stigma creates queerspecific threats and vulnerabilities, both offline and online. We also consider how other overlapping identities
play a role in risk by discussing research with other vulnerable or marginalized populations. Finally, we summarize prior research on general security advice and targeted advice.
2.1 Queer-Specific Risks
The specific harms and threats that queer folks face (offand online) due to stigma around sexual orientation or
gender have been well-documented.
Technology-independent risks. Risks to queer folks exist independent of technology (e.g., at school, home, and
work). Queer youth are more likely than their heterosexual and cisgender (or cis) counterparts to be bullied, consider suicide [5], and be homeless [9]. LGBT youth are
often homeless because they are thrown out by their parents upon learning they are gay [9]. While U.S. law technically protects LGBTQ+ people in the workplace [71],
in practice their jobs may still be at risk (e.g., a teacher
was reportedly fired for being gay after a student discovered his OKCupid profile [2]).
Transgender (or trans) folks, particularly Black or
Latino trans women, are disproportionately likely to face
violence [13]. Trans/gay panic, a legal defense for someone to justify violence against someone after finding out
they are transgender or queer, is still legal in 35 states [7].
Risks on social media. The risks of being out—public
about one’s identity as queer—indicate how important it
is for queer folks to be able to control access to their
information. Prior work has noted queer individuals do
not always feel safe presenting their queer identity to all
audiences on social media [23, 38, 28, 47, 92], a problem more generally known as context collapse [75]. This
can be especially stressful for transgender individuals
navigating transitioning and coming out on social media [52, 84, 53]. To manage different audiences, individuals use affordances including multiple social media
sites or accounts, private accounts, and granular post visibility [38, 28, 47].
Risks in online dating and sexting. Over half of lesbian, gay or bisexual American adults have used a dating app [16]. Online dating can provide queer individuals connection [99] and a space to explore one’s identity [38]. It is also a site of privacy tensions, as users
often provide location data, use it to connect with people outside of their known social network, and include
more sensitive information in profiles [34]. Recently
there have been scams extorting queer dating app users
by threatening to out them [6].
Sexting through dating apps or through other messaging apps has become a common practice in the U.S. [61],
and researchers have highlighted its positive role in relationship satisfaction [27, 40, 96]. Sexting also comes
with risks, such as non-consensual sharing of intimate
images, that have worse consequences for women and
non-binary individuals [48, 68].
Other risks. The prior sections are a non-exhaustive
list of possible harms targeted towards queer individuals. Queer and trans activists [69], refugees [17], sex
workers [76], and other vocations or identities face other
specific threats. Given that our paper is focused on advice for queer folks, not threat models, we leave the full
spectrum of financial, physical, relational, and emotional
harms [93] for different threat models largely to other
work. But we also touch on the importance of these overlapping identities in Section 2.2.
2.2 Intersectional Identities
To understand the complexity of why queer folks adopt
or reject advice, and their threat models, we use the
framework of intersectionality. This posits that oppression and power is better understood as shaped by multiple axes of identity [22], e.g. but not limited to, race,
gender, class, sexuality, and disability [36]. Here we define power as agency and access to resources [37], and
power dynamics as “differences in ability to take action
between parties” [104].
The reason we are explicitly looking at power is
because lack of power reduces one’s ability to resist,
reduce, or prevent harm [104, 19]. And individuals
marginalized across multiple identity axes are a bigger
target for harm. For example, being a woman raises one’s
risk of being harassed online, and this risk is higher for
queer women and women of color [33].
Intersectionality also helps us analyze “across domains of power” [22]: across interpersonal, cultural, disciplinary, and structural relationships. For example, a
queer employee may be fired by their company for being
gay (structural and cultural). And a queer person may be
abusive to their partner [42] (interpersonal). Harm can
come from institutions, as well as from other marginalized individuals [92, 104]. Given this, we are interested
in how individuals at certain intersections may not have
the same avenues of recourse after a security breach or
unsafe experience, and therefore do not adopt certain advice.
2.3 Security for Vulnerable Populations
There has been interest in the security community around
understanding the specific needs of different vulnerable
or marginalized populations. For example, this includes
studying older adults [45], people with visual impairments [60], sex trafficking survivors [31], refugees [94],
and journalists [79]. Our present work fits into that
space, deepening our understanding of the experiences
of queer individuals in trying to respond to their security/safety/privacy concerns. We hypothesize that some
of our conclusions are relevant to other marginalized
groups as well.
2.4 Security Advice
Advice evaluation. Providing security education to
users has often been a takeaway from user studies on
people’s security concerns and practices, especially for
marginalized groups [94, 31]. Researchers have said that
good security advice should be effective, actionable, and
understandable [89, 90]. Yet, general security advice online is often inactionable, whether due to the cost-benefit
trade-off not being worth it [62, 43], too much advice
existing with no prioritization [89, 20], or that “the right
advice might change over time with the attack landscape,
new technology, and experience” [90]. And security experts and non-experts have differing opinions on what
“good” advice is [66].
Sources of advice. Redmiles et al. found that people
often turned to their IT or computer science family and
friends for security advice, but people with higher socioeconomic status and technical skill tend to take more
advice from the workplace rather than from friends and
family [87]. Rader et al. pointed out that informal stories
between friends and family about security incidents are
useful to learning about security behaviors and changing
mental models [85].
Advice for specific populations. The safety priorities and contexts of queer individuals may be different
from the general population, and therefore warrant different advice, as “people from different under-served
groups may have profoundly different needs and challenges for security and privacy” [106]. Even amongst
queer individuals, queer life experiences and concerns
can be very different [97]. Security advice exists specifically for women [24], gay online dating [4], queer individuals using Instagram [8], and Black Lives Matter
protesters [103] to name a few examples. The Reconfigure Network organized security community workshops
and found that contrary to popular cybersecurity narratives that users are uninterested in security, their participants demonstrated care and thoughtfulness in both their
own and communal privacy practices, and their practices
are shaped by privilege and oppression [14]. We follow
Reconfigure’s epistemological approach (feminist standpoint theory) of looking to users as experts in their own
lives, rather than relying on threat models and advice developed by traditional security experts.
3 Methodology
To answer our research questions, we conducted semistructured qualitative interviews with queer individuals
who use social media, dating apps, or apps for sexting.
We asked participants what online safety advice they
have given and received, as well as their thought processes behind adopting or rejecting advice. We also collated online documents of queer safety advice as prompts
and asked participants how they felt about certain advice
relevant to their online activities.
3.1 Interview Protocol
We developed an interview script to ask questions about:
What concerns have participants had about online
security / safety / privacy related to queerness? Related to other aspects of their identity? Why do they
have these concerns?
2. Have participants ever changed their behaviors to
deal with these concerns? How or where did they
learn to change their behaviors? Have behavior
changes ever failed to solve the problem?
3. Have participants given online safety / security / privacy advice to others?
4. What online advice have participants seen but decided was not for them?
5. If people are unconcerned about online safety / security / privacy, what are they resigned to?
The full interview protocol can be found in Appendix 9.1.
Advice Prompts. We also gathered queer safety advice
available online as prompts for participants to think about
behaviors related to concerns they had (Appendix 9.2).
These prompts were collated from ten pages of online
search results for “lgbtq online safety advice”. Our goal
wasn’t to systematically evaluate advice: instead it was
to probe participants about what it would be like adopting
behavior they had either never thought of or didn’t have
in recent memory. Therefore, not all participants were
asked about the same advice, because it wasn’t always
relevant to them. Some prompt examples include “use
2-factor authentication” and “on a first date, don’t meet
at home.”
Procedure. Interviews were conducted remotely either
by phone or by video conferencing program, depending
on participant choice. They ranged from 45 to 90 minutes. Participants were compensated with a $30 gift card.
Calls were recorded with participant consent. Only audio
data was saved; all video was deleted after the interview.
Interviews were transcribed by two researchers to
avoid third-party access to interview data, and were
anonymized in the transcription process. Quotes used
in this paper are paraphrased for clarity and further
anonymity.
Ethics. Due to the potentially harmful memories our interview questions could bring up, we took care to follow best practices from trauma-aware research. We emphasized to participants that they could skip any question and end the interview at any time and still receive
compensation. The interviewer listened without judgement and offered participants time to take a moment if
needed following a sensitive disclosure. The interviewer
also had the Trevor Project hotline number available in
case a participant needed to be directed to a counselor
(though no participant used the number). We also followed best practices to ethically conduct research with
marginalized populations [105], including providing fair
compensation and sending the research output (e.g., the
paper) to participants after publication. Our study was
approved by the University of Washington IRB.
3.2 Participants
We recruited 14 queer participants diverse across age,
race, disability, and economic and educational status (Table 1). We determined saturation at 14 participants after no new higher-level themes emerged from the data
and at which point we no longer needed to refine themes
after subsequent interviews. Their self-reported gender
and sexuality are in Table 2. Participants were recruited
through flyers around a major city in the U.S., as well
as through postings in queer listservs and other online
communities. We also collected demographic information on community type since prior research has shown
that queer folks in rural environments face unique concerns [50]. Ten participants live in urban areas, three in
suburban areas, and one in a rural area.
3.3 Data Analysis
We conducted thematic analysis on the transcripts, using
primarily inductive coding [26]. First, two independent
coders familiarized themselves with all transcripts [25].
Then they independently coded four interviews before
discussing code choices and agreeing on an intermediate codebook. During the discussion process, they began
deductively coding using threat modeling as a framework
to include threats and mitigation behaviors as lowerlevel codes, to be integrated into higher-level themes.
They doubled-coded eight more interviews, stopping every two interviews to discuss changes to the codes and
higher level themes, until consensus was reached. All
transcripts were recoded as necessary. One coder coded
the final two interviews.
Inter-rater reliability (IRR) was not calculated because
our research goal is the richness and nuance of different
experiences, not counts of how often a theme occurred,
and because we double-coded and reached consensus on
nearly all transcripts [78].
3.4 Author Positionality
Our work is undergirded by feminist standpoint theory,
which calls for an understanding that social knowledge
and experiences are situated in a specific context [56, 95].
Therefore, we emphasize that the narrative of our results
is influenced by our own perspectives and backgrounds.
Some authors identify as queer or non-binary and others
identify as straight and cis. The authors are either East
Asian or white. From an intersectional framework, we
recognize that some of us are marginalized across some
axes of identity and not others, and that our identities do
not fully reflect those of our participants.
4 Results
To provide context for our results, we begin by briefly
summarizing key points from participants’ threat models. Participants mentioned concerns around homophobic and/or transphobic workplaces, government actors,
online strangers, corporations, friends, and family. Some
participants were also concerned about harassment from
within queer communities. Threats and concerns included, but are not limited to, deadnaming (use of a trans
or non-binary person’s former name without their consent), transphobic and homophobic harassment, doxxing,
losing one’s job for being queer, and physical violence.
We now dive into our core research questions, detailing where participants found online safety, security, or
privacy information for these threats, their barriers to
finding useful advice, and how identity played a role in
their advice evaluation.
4.1 Advice Sources
Our participants named a variety of sources from which
they either learned something accidentally or they intentionally looked for advice. Purposefully looking for advice was sometimes motivated by a security incident the
participant or someone they knew had.
4.1.1 Asking community
Friends and family. Echoing previous work [85, 88],
our participants turned to friends and family for safety
advice. Some people like P14 mentioned turning to
someone in their life who knows tech-related things, in
her case her son, who works in IT, for a question on Facebook bans. P1’s friends turned to P1 for social media
privacy questions because they have a computer security
job, even though it is unrelated to social media. Rather
than purposely turning to a loved one, P9 learned privacy
advice from her partner incidentally. He brought up in
casual conversation,
‘I read online that TikTok is doing such and
such things.’ I was like that’s probably true.
But it is a very fun dumb app, so I am going to
continue using it.
On the other hand, P11 (cis man, gay) for example,
asked a friend with a shared threat model—rather than
specific technical expertise—for advice:
You know, a lot of her concerns [around dating] as a female...I’ve also learned and realize that this could also be valuable to me as...a
queer male.
Queer community. Other participants specifically asked
those with whom they shared their queer identity for advice, either because they felt—like P11 with his female
friend—that they had a shared identity-based harm or because they had a queer-specific concern. They turned either to their informal queer friend groups or formal queer
support groups. For example, at a get-together with
queer friends, P13 gave advice to a friend who wanted
to put their “full authentic self” online. Other attendees
at the get-together also shared their differing opinions
on whether to be more private or public online, creating
what P13 described as “kind of a round [table] barbecue.”
When P4 (trans man, gay) found a coworker on Grindr
and realized they were accidentally outed to each other,
and became concerned his workplace would find out, he
turned to his trans men support group to hear their experiences and advice on what to do next. As P4 puts it, “It
wasn’t like we had a leader, but we all just sort of compared notes about what we were doing.” Having a group
of people to talk to let participants hear about different
experiences so they could make an informed decision on
what to do next.
For P14 and P12, their Facebook lesbian or LGBTQ+
support groups experienced harassment themselves, and
they would turn to in-group members for help.
P6 incidentally came across privacy advice from her
queer community, rather than purposely seeking out advice. P6 frequents Twitter and follows other trans and
autistic people, some who are very security and privacy
conscious. She learned about how to change what gender
Twitter assumed she was after seeing a viral tweet about
it on her Twitter feed.
Benefit of asking community: emotional support.
Getting advice sometimes came with emotional support,
which was more common when people sought advice
from their trusted community. And it may be especially
important right after a harmful event. For example, P12
turned to her queer cousin after getting cyberbullied for
posting LGBTQ+ related topics on social media. She described reaching out to her queer cousin as,
really beneficial. Yeah, I took [the advice] into
consideration because I felt I had someone that
really cared about me and that really accepted
me for who I was.
P14 also took physical privacy advice from his queer
community on Tumblr, which previously helped him
process and validate his coming out experience with his
family. Emotional support helped build trust and gave
P14 a place to turn to for future concerns.
When P8 provided advice to an older woman who was
worried about sharing a Zoom link publicly, they also
worked to calm her fears. P8 said,
I got this whole Boomer crew that are like,
maybe you can teach us [how to Zoom screen
share] sometime...And so those are the people
who I am both their cheerleader and acknowledge that their fears might have some foundation. To be cautious, but also to embolden
them.
Safety concerns and behaviors were tied to emotions, so
receiving and providing emotional support was helpful
for these participants. P8 stressed the comforting aspect:
I don’t push. I don’t push as a practitioner
[with] whatever I’m doing with my [yoga]
clients, whether it’s this kind of [safety concern] conversation or the actual meat of my
services. I have to acknowledge where they
are.
4.1.2 Learned through vocation or school
For P7, online security was often discussed not just in
her home, but also at school or work:
We literally have to watch like these presentations every year on ’this is why you need to
change your password and confidentiality’ and
blah blah and just keeping unauthorized access
at a low.
Redmiles et al. also noted the workplace as a source
of digital security advice “in the form of newsletters, IT
emails, or required trainings” [88].
P7 learned to change their passwords at least once a
year, something they continue to do today, from their
high school media technology class. They received a
hard drive to save their art and was told to “put your
personal password on there to protect it because it’s no
one else’s fault if any of your stuff gets erased.” This
notion of personal responsibility and concern over art
theft, which happened to their friends and almost happened to them, cemented this security behavior. P14, a
former teacher, taught her students about how sharing on
social media isn’t always private: “If you wouldn’t want
a potential employer to see it in 10 years, you shouldn’t
be writing it now.” And P6 learned about cat-fishing
(someone being deceptive in their online dating profile)
through a film at her autistic education program.
4.1.3 Searching the web or platform settings
For questions about specific settings, actions, or programs, where the participant already knew the term for
what they were looking for, some participants turned to
an Internet search engine.
For example, P5 did extensive research on what VPN
to use based on their requirement that it not sell their data
to third parties. And for advice on dating security and
privacy for young women, P3 turned to a YouTube channel run by someone who was previously in an abusive
relationship.
P1 was looking for how to change a specific Facebook
setting, but only found outdated information that did not
apply to their Android phone. P12 looked up how to
block someone on Facebook, and someone directed P14
to search Facebook’s website for how to block someone,
but P14 did not find the site information as helpful as
instructions from her friend, who had to block the same
person harassing their lesbian Facebook Group.
P8, P11, and P13 mentioned not knowing what language to use to search for certain safety-related information, which will be discussed more below in Section 4.2.1.
4.2 Barriers to Finding and Following Advice
We detail difficulties participants encountered to finding security, safety, and privacy information, as listed
in Table 3. While inconvenience was sometimes cited
as the reason that advice did not work (as in prior
work [62, 88]), our participants faced additional tradeoffs as well.
4.2.1 No language for it
P8 and P11 both stated they did not know how to phrase
their safety questions to search online, with P8 saying
that after having someone duplicate their Instagram account to scam others, “I wouldn’t know how to even begin formulating the questions. I’m not even sure what my
question would be.” During the interview, they said they
might search “How do I protect myself?” And P13 said
he was not aware that safety advice specifically for queer
folks is something that could be found on the Internet.
We note that P8 is in their 40s and started using the
Internet in the 90s, P11 is in his 20s, and P13 is in his 60s.
Youth and being introduced to the Internet at a young age
do not necessarily translate to broad Internet expertise
and skills [57].
Some of our participants did bring safety knowledge
from one platform to another, but this tended to be analogous experiences of learning to block users on, for example, MySpace and transferring that knowledge to Facebook (P2), or knowledge of Telnet and SMTP’s lack of
encryption to leading to skepticism of contemporary Internet traffic (P10).
4.2.2 Solution could not be found online
There were a few questions participants had that they
could not find answers to. P14 was not sure how a troll’s
account was still able to harass her on Facebook after she
blocked the account. P5 could not find any authoritative
source on whether “don’t let children talk to adults on
the Internet” is reasonable advice (P5 disagreed with this
advice because they thought then only predators would
talk with children online). P3 tried to learn how to block
plastic-surgery related tags which triggered her anxiety
on TikTok, but found the app does not have that functionality. And finally, P4 could not find a way to force
people to untag his pre-transition photos.
4.2.3 Advice would interfere with material livelihood
As we discuss more below, people’s identities are multifaceted. As a result, identity-specific advice to be more
cautious online sometimes interferes with their other
goals and/or other parts of their identities: for example,
participants who also relied on social media for work and
income.
For example, P4, a writer, made his Facebook account
private after a friend had their social media account duplicated. Eventually, he made his account public again:
[A friend would say] ’It’s such a great post, I
want to share it,’ and I’m a writer, and so I’d
be like yeah I wrote this this long thing that I
would love for you to share but you can’t....It’s
not that I’m trying to get exposure on my personal profiles, but I’d like to get my name out
there and that was counter-intuitive.
P8, who had their Instagram business account duplicated by a scammer, also did not like the advice to make
their account private because doing so would harm their
business. P10 mentioned giving advice to a friend who
is an event promoter, who was trying to deal with unsolicited messages on his promoter social media page.
While P10 suggested to make a separate personal page,
his friend did not take this advice, which P10 mused
was because, “I guess when you do promotions in the
gay world, everyone is your friend.” One could see the
reverse as well, that every friend is a potential event
attendee. These examples illustrate how social media
use is sometimes tied to income, and ultimately, financial well-being, which limits people’s options for dealing
with privacy concerns.
Advice would interfere with joy and relationships
Aside from convenience, participants also noted tradeoffs of losing human connection and joy as reasons to
not adopt certain security or privacy measures, showing
the role emotion plays around security concerns [85], as
well as in decision-making in general [30]. Participants
who were concerned about harassment on social media
or threats from online dating considered the trade-off of
using more cautious safety behaviors versus missing potential connection with others.
P14, although she had experienced trolls harassing her
on Facebook, did not like the idea of making her account
private because having a public account allowed her to
meet new people: “It was good to be open to new people
in a safe way.”
Other participants also considered romantic and sexual
connections in their decisions. P3 stated that while she
found “don’t show your face in sexts” to be reasonable
advice, she did not follow it for “vanity reasons”. P2,
a trans woman, is concerned about being vulnerable to
a trans or gay panic defense, where someone can excuse
assault or murder by blaming the victim’s gender identity
or sexual orientation for the assailant’s actions [7].
At the same time, P2, who is in her 50s, transitioned
and made a lot of life changes in the past couple years,
and so will “swing for the fences....I’m just gonna try to
live before I die....and make up for lost time.” For her,
that means dating as much as possible. While she does
take precautions for her physical safety by deciding to
disclose in her online profile that she is trans and tell a
friend if she will meet someone, she is “apprehensive of
this in terms of communications through social media.
I’m expecting a lot of transphobia.”
These examples indicate how while folks value their
personal safety, they also value joy and connections in
their life. Advice and online safety options for queer
folks ideally would not decrease their opportunities to
have positive relationships with others, particularly since
queer stigma already decreases access to relationships.
And as other research notes, there are benefits to visibility for queer folks [28].
4.2.5 Distrust in advice source
Some participants mentioned they would not turn to a
source or did not trust the advice they saw there. Reasons included that they didn’t want to be sold something
(echoing [88]), or they didn’t trust the source given how
the source’s interests differed from their users.
For example, P5, when looking for a VPN that did not
sell data to third-parties, searched the web for guides that
were not trying to market VPNs to them. They ended
up relying on a guide created by what they considered a
reputable source, like Wired or Technology Review.
P8 expressed a similar sentiment when explaining why
they did not search the Internet for what to do after their
Instagram account got duplicated: “I think I’m also fearful that I’d be sold something. I have that experience,
and I didn’t buy anything and nothing bad happened.”
Some participants turned to platforms themselves for
information on how to manage their privacy or safety.
But they did not always trust that the platform would prioritize user interests over their own. P11 stated about
Reddit,
...there’s some mistrust that I have with some
of these platforms where I’m like...do they actually want anonymity? Or do they actually
want people to be...moving in this direction
where like you have a profile and like, they can
personalize things for you right? There’s more
gain for the business, I think, to do that, than
there necessarily could be for me.
4.2.6 Advice becoming out-of-date
Some participants had difficulty using the Internet to find
up-to-date security information. P1 tried to find how to
change a Facebook privacy setting, but could not find
updated advice that worked for their new version of Android OS. When searching for how to make his Facebook
more secure, P4 found it helpful that the guide he found
had additional user comments
saying like this is outdated. They don’t do
this anymore. Or, that’s not how that technology works, like almost fact checking the people and saying, you know, this little thing you
said was inaccurate or...yes thank you so much,
you’ve helped me.
As P3 and Reeder et al. noted, technology constantly
changes, so solutions and threats can also change [90].
4.2.7 Sense of futility in adopting behaviors
Finally, a general barrier we observed to adopting advice
was a sense of futility, that any actions a person might
take would not address the issue they were concerned
about.
For example, after their friend got doxxed, P1 (both
of them activists) searched for privacy-enhancing behaviors, while their friend thought, “Well, it’s all out there
now. There’s not much I can do”. P9 was also concerned
about having worse backlash if she tries to take action,
like asking a site to take down her personally identifiable information, citing the “Streisand effect”: “the phenomenon whereby the attempt to suppress something
only brings more attention or notoriety to it.” [11]. This
discouraged her from looking for recourse.
Referencing their identities, P2 and P6 both expressed
an acceptance that their engaging in social media or online dating is always going to come with some threat of
transphobic people, even with their mitigating behaviors.
P6, who never uses the word TERF (trans-exclusionary
radical feminist) on Twitter so that transphobes don’t find
her tweet and harass her, notes that one of her tweets did
go viral once which led to some exposure to harassers.
[Some people,] anytime they see trans people existing online they decide to harass them
when they show up on their feed....anytime you
get to a big enough reach with a tweet, it’s kind
of inevitable that some shitty people will see it
and want to be shitty at you.
P2 gave up trying to report harassers on Facebook, because:
It seems like people can catch a ban for something, just for calling someone a bigot for example. But if you actually try to report a transphobic comment, they’re not going to care.
She instead only blocks people on Facebook (whereas
on Twitter she will both block people and report people
for transphobia). Similarly, P14 distrusted Facebook for
banning her for using a term for underwear, but not banning a poster for homophobic content. This compounded
with her distrust when she had blocked a homophobic
harasser, but the harasser came back. She blamed Facebook for blocking not working (whether harasser made a
second account or got around the block or ban remains
unclear).
Our participants are not alone in their sense of futility. Indeed, Hoffman et al. propose that this world
view is actually very rational: “privacy cynicism” is
a coping mechanism for Internet users dealing with
institution-level, often insurmountable, threats [65]. This
coping mechanism may also extend to culture-based
threats [22], given, as our participants described, that
there are many transphobic and homophobic users online, and moderation policies do not always adequately
address this. Our participants did react to threats from
their immediate social environment, e.g., cyberbullying,
which Hoffman et al. notes is where fatalism is least
strong. We discuss the necessity of moving responsibility of safety from vulnerable individuals to powerful
institutions in Section 5.2.2.
4.3 Identity
While most participants mentioned safety concerns related to their sexual orientation or gender, they also
had overlapping and non-overlapping concerns related
to other aspects of their identity, such as their race or
age. We discuss how these different facets, including
gender more in-depth, impact what advice participants
seek based on their threats, and impact their perceptions
of advice.
Transitioning. Transitioning is the process where one
changes one’s gender presentation to match one’s internal sense of identity. Transitioning while on social media
can lead to both stress and support [52], and can result in
shifting threat models and security needs.
For P4, who didn’t want to publicly transition on Facebook during early 2010s, the process led him to search
how to force people to untag him from old pre-transition
photos.
There was either no information or there was
no way to do it. So, some of that stuff still exists because those people either no longer use
Facebook, or just didn’t do it....I wish there had
been like here’s a step by step guide of how
to clean up your social media without deleting your entire account and restarting it. Most
places I searched would say just start over.
This reflects prior work indicating that transitioning
users either try to remove old photos or change visibility of those photos on Facebook [53].
P1 also experienced this difficulty of trying to get
others to untag their old photos. For P5 (non-binary),
transitioning and getting top surgery led to them getting
less unsolicited messages, as they no longer presented or
were perceived as femme.
Parental Responsibility. After P2 transitioned, she took
certain actions to protect her son from transphobic harm,
reflecting other queer parents considering their children’s
privacy [23]. She doesn’t bring up her son’s name online
because:
I just don’t want [a] transphobe [to] somehow
infiltrate my [Facebook] friends list and then
track him down and cause him harm. I don’t
put the name of the school or anything like
that....I would [also] try to make sure I didn’t
have any identifying information in the background of the [school] photo for example so
that they can figure out where it is....That’s
probably my biggest fear right now, that my
son will get bullied or worse, or otherwise, or
hurt because of me.
Age. P8 (non-binary, 45-54) also discussed getting unsolicited sexual messages and accepting that risk as part
of navigating the world while feminine-presenting. She
added though, “the older I get the more invisible I am.”
For P14 (65-74), aging was an accumulation of stressful discrimination, because of her mobility impairment,
religion, and sexuality. She did not want to take the time
to learn how to make her church’s page private after receiving homophobic harassment because, “When you get
old enough and lesbian enough, then you try to deal with
that kind of stressful stuff as fast as possible and move
on.”
Gender. Women are more likely to receive online sexual
harassment and stalking than men [100]. We previously
detailed how some of our participants, when interpreted
as femme, received unsolicited messages. And P3, a cis
woman, stated she found it harder to find dating safety
advice for queer women than for gay men. Future research should study the quantity and quality of advice
that is available to queer sub-communities.
Race. Race also affected how people felt about their
risks moving through the world, as described above. P9
stated, “I’m a white person, so I’ve never been afraid of
being a white person on the Internet.”
P11 was concerned about dating for both his Asian
friend and himself, due to the risk of being stereotyped
as submissive and someone aggressive attempting to take
advantage of them.
I think being an Asian man that is queer,
there’s also these fears of being objectified or
sexualized and perceived as being submissive.
He also ruminated on his identity and how that might
affect how he perceives online dating advice: “It does
feel really fear-based and fear-driven, you know, which I
think like in Asian culture can be a big thing.”
Relationship with the state. Race also impacted opinions on advice related to the police. When asked whether
they found the advice of having a police app (an app
that will instantly dial the police with the user’s location)
handy during a date, P10 (biracial, Black and white) said
he would never use it because he’s been racially profiled
in a gay neighborhood. He stated,
“The police start questioning me about where
do I live, am I homeless....[This incident] really ticked me off because, I’m gay, it’s the
[gay neighborhood], that’s supposed to be my
community.”
P5 (non-binary, autistic) also did not like the advice,
citing previous incidents of police acting violently towards queer and/or autistic individuals. P11 stated it
could be useful to someone to give them a sense of security, but he would never call the police on a date. P4 (gay,
cis man) didn’t trust the police to show up and doing anything, because they ignored his friend getting beat up by
a hook-up since the friend and hook-up were both men.
He said he trusts friends more, similar to P2. Different
aspects of their identities affected participant’s relationship with the state and with the utility of the police app
advice.
Harms within queer communities. Many participants
had queer friends they trusted and could turn to, but this
coexists with the reality that queer individuals can also
harm other queer individuals. Scheuerman et al. found
that transgender folks can experience harm online from
both outsiders and insiders of a queer community [92].
Examples of peer-to-peer harms included invalidating
a specific identity (e.g., bisexuality [104] or non-binary)
within a queer space. P5 mentioned that one time they
disagreed in a Twitter thread about how to use pronouns.
I got shouted down by another queer person....I
try to stay away from people who are yelling at
other queer people.
Advice should specify if the threat model is potential
harms from within a community itself or from outside.
5 Discussion and Future Work
We review the implications of our findings for the development of security advice, for security research more
broadly, and areas of investigation for future research.
5.1 Takeaways for Better, Inclusive Safety
and Security Advice
Here we provide takeaways for how advice can be improved for queer and non-queer folks, both for communicating advice through conversation, or through written
documents that contain advice.
5.1.1 Accept there is no one-size-fits all advice
While mitigations can transfer to other contexts, there is
not always a universal solution to a threat because people have different values and circumstances in life [39],
as well as different threat models. While some behaviors were common and discussed positively (like blocking people who were causing harm), participants differed
on other points such as whether to make social media accounts private. Some of our participants did so to avoid
information leakage, and others did not because they
needed or wanted social exposure. A behavior option
that impairs joy or financial stability is not a fair choice.
Specificity is better than consistency. While Reeder
et al. noted that it is an issue when advice is inconsistent across multiple sources [90], we suggest that consistency is not, perhaps the most important goal. Instead, specificity—as we describe approaches below—
may better enable people to have autonomy in evaluating
what advice is most appropriate for their individual situation. Wade et al. also noted this issue of not including
validation or reasoning in BLM protestor advice [103].
Furthermore, Reeder et al. noted technology and other
factors change over time, so efforts to create fully consistent advice may find themselves quickly outdated [90].
Provide explanations. To achieve specificity, documents should explain the reasoning behind advice, mirroring how in-person questions allow follow-up questions, for example. Providing reasoning can, however,
conflict with another prior recommendation for the creation of security advice: concision. Our results suggest
that concise advice may also not be ideal. P4 and P5
both mentioned researching articles to find the advice
they were looking for, and the detailed explanations of
how technology could be used increased their trust in the
article. And P9, when prompted with the advice “Use
a private account,” asked for an explanation of why one
should do that before she could say it was good advice or
not. As Berdan writes about security advice for journalists, “good advice is rarely a punchy soundbite” [20].
While adding “hows” and “whys” will lengthen documents, advice could be shortened by focusing on a specific threat to mitigate. For example, rather than writing a general online safety advice list for queer folks,
a document could focus on a specific platform (e.g.
Grindr [4], Instagram [8]), activity (e.g. transitioning, activism), or threat (e.g., being outed to family and friends,
community in-fighting, extortion scams on queer dating
apps [6]). Advice could be tailored towards platform
novices or platform experts, especially given prior work
suggesting differences in protective behavior amongst
those with different levels of digital skill [58, 32].
5.1.2 Share emotional and communal support with
advice
Communication research has pointed out that advice preceded by emotional support was considered higher quality [44]. Security clinic professionals provide emotional support as part-and-parcel of their service [101],
which is necessary for clients facing intimate partner violence [102]. In community security workshops, relieving anxiety and making sure participants feel in control
of their lives is an important part of the security teaching/learning process [14]. While our work cannot discern
whether or not participants were more likely to accept
advice when it came with emotional support, several of
our participants did seek it out, and P12 spoke positively
when the friend she turned to after a cyber-bullying incident provided it.
Further, P4 discussed how his trans men support group
would “compare notes about what we were doing” when
providing advice. He was looking for information on
whether to delete his old account prior to his transition or
to just untag all photos, and people in his group described
their experience doing different things before P4 made
his decision. (He opted to untag photos so he wouldn’t
get questions about why his Facebook account was so
new.) Thus, his group was engaged in collaborative advice giving, perhaps leading to group members feeling
less alone in their struggles.
Support security workshops and existing support
groups. Given how our results indicate the benefit of
support groups as a space to ask questions and share experiences, as well as provide emotional support, safety
advice may be better discussed in a group setting. As
Slupska et al. writes, “Cybersecurity is more effective
when it is communal...Discuss[ing] online threats and
mitigations with members of a community makes it easier and less intimidating to take action.”
This can look like security researchers hosting community workshops, e.g., CryptoHarlem [3], Reconfigure
Network, and PEN America [12]. It could also look
like security researchers providing resources for existing
queer support groups in some fashion. These cybersecurity advocates need to have “people skills”, empathy, and
respect for user capabilities in order to establish trusting
relationships and empower users to believe in their own
abilities [54, 55].
Research with other stigmatized groups have also
shown the importance of online discussion forums and
communities for developing and distributing risk mitigation strategies, such as sex workers [21]. For online
settings, creating affordances for collaborative discussion and feedback on advice documents may create better
buy-in, sense of emotional support, and ability to archive
out-of-date advice. Regardless of the format, it is important that the advice-giver listens to the individual’s needs
as they are experts in their own lives [14, 95].
5.1.3 Communicate credibility
As prior advice research [89], credibility research [80],
and our results show, participants distrusted sites that
seemed to market a product. Credible advice should not
look like it is selling something. Future work should look
at what degree of marketing content that credibility drops
off, e.g., a social media site with poor reputation versus
a blog with some advertisements.
Also, some participants distrusted privacy instructions
on platform sites, since they consider platforms to pri-
oritize business interests over user harm. Therefore it is
important for third parties, like the Electronic Frontier
Foundation [10], to continue writing advice and instructions on controlling security and privacy settings. At the
same time, platforms should still provide instructions for
security settings as well, given that participants chose to
look there.
5.2 Takeaways for Security Research
5.2.1 Incorporating intersectionality in security research
Our findings with our diverse participants underscore
an intersectional understanding of power and threats,
which we argue should be considered systematically
when threat modeling. Some intersectionality themes
relevant to social factors security research include:
1. Someone marginalized across multiple identities
may not have the same agency to reduce harm as
someone marginalized across one identity [37].
2. Members of one marginalized group can harm another marginalized group. As Collins writes, “Depending on the context, an individual may be an oppressor, a member of an oppressed group, or simultaneously oppressor and oppressed” [63].
3. Oppression (and harm) can come from interpersonal
connections, culture, disciplinary structures, or institutions [22], and an individual under threat in one
relationship might have agency in a different relationship.
As the security field continues to research specific
populations, an intersectional approach will be useful to
understand how the threats within one population may
differ. Recruiting a diverse set of queer participants
was important for us to illustrate how people often had
concerns related to multiple axes of identity, e.g., being
Asian American and gay. For some, concerns related to
another identity were prioritized over their queerness in
the moment of the interview. These examples show how
in different contexts, one axis of oppression might be
more relevant than others, and threat modeling for someone should explore these priorities. We argue that differences are just as important to study and design for as generalities, since there is no universal technology user [35].
These intersectional identities also affected what advice would work or participants could afford to adopt:
P8 was not able to make their business Instagram profile private after being harassed due to potential loss of
customers, and multiple participants did not trust reporting homophobic and transphobic posts to Facebook because they have seen such posts remain up. The power
difference between the individual and adversary affects
one’s sense of agency in controlling one’s safety. Making power imbalances explicit in threat modeling is important to understanding what mitigations an individual
is capable of, and when structural changes are necessary.
While this framework surfaces how the queer experience is not a monolith, it also reveals when harm mitigations are transferable to others (which Wang also mentions as a motivation to pursue inclusive security and privacy [106]). For example, Nova et al. recommends that
online platforms design group-level blocking functionality, as people of the queer Hijra identity from Bangladesh
are “significantly influenced by their group dynamics and
largely dependent on the sharing of information within
communities” [81]. P14 had difficulty learning to block
a harasser in her elder lesbian Facebook group, and could
benefit from this affordance. Reichel also notes that
low-income South African mobile users rely on blocking rather than Facebook settings for privacy protection [91]. Future work could explore when similar effects of marginalization across different groups can lead
to similar threat models, as well as when affordances are
common enough across platforms (e.g., blocking) that it
can be recommended generally.
5.2.2 Limitations of security advice as personal responsibility
While improving security advice for queer individuals is
important, advice as a solution for harms is limited because it places an overwhelming responsibility on an individual [74, 95]. Individual behaviors will not always
work because a) the problems folks face may involve
other people (e.g., networked privacy [74]), and b) when
institutions are the threat, individuals don’t have equal
resources and power.
Prior research notes that managing security and privacy can be a communal goal [81, 60, 107], and that because privacy is networked, one person’s disclosure decisions inevitably affect their entire social circle [75, 74].
And as mentioned earlier, some of P2’s privacy behaviors
around her being transgender is to protect her son. Advice can be formulated with a community in mind, such
as Pen America’s online harassment guide for witnesses
and allies [12].
Individual or communal advice also has limits when
threats are powerful institutions, such as corporations
or governments, or culture (e.g., transphobia). The futility some of our participants experienced around online harms are clearer with this context, and moving responsibility of safety to those in power would better address certain threats. Research on problematic content in
ads [108], privacy policy unreadability [77], sex worker
safety [19], prisoner surveillance [82], undocumented
immigrant surveillance [51], to name a few contexts, all
recommend government or platform policy changes to
best protect their target users. We support and contribute
research to improve safety advice, while also pointing
out the necessity of structural changes to make queer
lives safer (e.g., banning gay/trans panic defense [7],
communal blocking on platforms [1]).
5.3 Future Work
Our work focuses on queer folks in the U.S., but there are
other contexts security advice can be analyzed through
other than by community or population. Pierce et al. outlined spectrums of security toolkit traits: some toolkits
were designed to be used before an incident (preventative) or after (provoked responses), and some were designed to be done once or done regularly (security hygiene) [83]. Future research could look into how security advice meant for regular checkups might work better
as a concise checkbox list, particularly for those already
familiar with security behaviors, while something communicated after an incident may require more tact and
emotional support.
For support groups, we raise the question of when
”technical” experts are needed, and what kind of expertise is lacking. If experts are integrated into a group, how
do you train an expert to ensure they are suited for their
outsider role? Future research can explore collaborating with online support groups to understand how advice gets adopted, as online support groups have been
known to provide advice and emotional support for specific communities [15, 76, 18]. Finally, it remains an
open question whether seeing conflicting advice lowers
users’ trust in an advice source.
While we used threat modeling to help organize our
results, we did not follow particular information-seeking
theories. Health research has differently modeled seeking safety information related to risk, e.g., diseases or
natural disasters [29]. Future advice research could incorporate theory outside security, e.g., the planned risk
information seeking model [67].
Finally, we ask when is it better to study a specific
threat model or platform versus a specific identity when
it comes to designing for harm mitigation or educating
for harm mitigation.
6 Limitations
This research scratches the surface of queer-intersecting
identities that lead to other vulnerabilities (e.g. LGBTQ+
refugees [17], sex workers [72], HIV positive folks [70],
victims of intimate partner violence [42], activists [69],
and parents [23] as a non-exhaustive list) or different
contexts (non-U.S. cultures and nationalities [17, 81]).
We provide a foundation for security researchers to think
intersectionally when threat modeling and addressing
harms when multiple identities play a role in risk.
Our work faces limitations common to qualitative
work: we cannot evaluate the popularity of a source or
test statistical significance of identity factors on decisionmaking. We leave this to future work.
We believe our general insights into traits of good advice is transferrable to other contexts [59], but future
research is needed to understand when and where specific advice (e.g., “use a private account”) works best.
Our work also focuses on queer folks generally, including both cisgender and transgender individuals. As noted
earlier, transgender individuals face specific vulnerabilities [69], and advice research with transgender folks
specifically is also needed.
7 Conclusion
We studied where LGBTQ+ folks in the U.S. turn to for
safety, security, and privacy advice because this population faces unique threats from their families, communities, and the state due to homophobia and transphobia.
Through qualitative interviews with 14 diverse queer individuals, we found participants turned to queer support
groups, whom they trusted and often shared threat models with, for help, in addition to other sources listed in
prior security advice work. Participants cited loss of
business or joy of connecting with others as reasons to
not adopt advice, in addition to inconvenience.
Other aspects of identity like race and age played a
role in what threats participants expected and looked to
advice for. We recommend that advice favor specificity
over consistency because different identities can lead to
different threat models. We also argue for using intersectionality to understand how interlocking identities lead to
higher risk of harms or constrain what mitigating behaviors people can adopt. We also echo calls for policy and
other structural approaches to make marginalized populations safer, rather than only focusing on personal responsibility to find good advice. Finally, our work provides a foundation for understanding how overlapping
identity threat models affect advice-seeking.
